These scripts are meant to be small re-usable examples for various tasks with Boto.  They were created for a presentation at the Python Web Development Meetup (http://www.meetup.com/Python-Web-Development/events/114056722/), but are also meant to be a starting point for creating your own scripts.

10* through 32* are examples for managing and creating EC2 instances.
40* through 43* are examples for managing and creating EBS volumes.
60* through 72* are examples for managing and creating Load Balancers and Auto Scaling Groups.
80-sns.py is simple example of sending an email notification through SNS.
